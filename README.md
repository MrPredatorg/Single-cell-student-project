Hello! My name is Evgeny Zyryansky, and this is my project!🙂
To make the bioinformatical project you need download the GSE130708_RAW.tar file from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130708

Then you need to run RStudio and put GSE130708_RAW.tar in your Working Directory
And then you can open and activate the "full_code.R" file, or perfom the project in parts.

To execute the code in parts, activate the .R files in the following order: 

Packages -> File_modification -> Transforming_iso_matrix -> Preprocessing ->
Merging -> Making_diff_expression

You should also know that folders with .R files contain graphs and intermediate files that you can get at a specific stage.

I hope you will enjoy the project. Good luck!! 😁 😊 😊
